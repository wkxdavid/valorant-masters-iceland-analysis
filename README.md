Some additional things may be needed to properly use those codes as it was transfered from personal storage. Some of the functions may be calling the data incorrectly.

The python software will need to be able to
import plotly, pandas, sklearn.metrics.
For theses below:
    import pandas as pd
    import plotly.express as px
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

To remove or use a specific function, go to the main method in valorant.py and
comment methods out.
Otherwise, all of the programs will default be on.
There is a KDA.PNG that shows what the product of the data visualization should look like.

To merge the two datasets, use the function highest_KDA_players()

To plot the KDA's, use the function test_total_map_picked()

The rest of the functions should be for the machine learning aspect.
